<h2>Build Your HTML</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create your html boilerplate in the index.htmlfile.</li>
<li>Add a new file called style.cssand link it to the HTML file.</li>
<li>In the body of your HTML, use header, main, and footertags to clearly define the different parts of the page.</li>
<li>Use an h1 tag for the site title and an h2for the subtitle inside the page header.</li>


<br/>
<h3>Use navtags inside the page header to create an accessible navigation. Follow the example in the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) Guidelines to format your navigation:</h3>

<li>Wrap each link in an anchor tag</li>
<li>Wrap each anchor tag in a list item</li>
<li>Wrap all of the list item tags in an unordered list tag</li>
<li>Place the unordered list inside the the nav tag and give it attributes for aria-label="Main Navigation"and role="navigation"</li>
<br/>
<h3>Mark up both of the blog posts using the articletag.</h3>
Use this W3C WAI Guideline example, to help you structure your blog post content.</li><br/>
Follow the pattern! Make sure there is a p tag that contains some lorem ipsum text</li> <br/>
(Remember you can create this with Emmet by typing p>lorem and pressing tab)!
Make sure your images all have altattributes so that they are accessible.
<li>Inside the page footer, use the same technique you used earlier to create a semantic and accessible navigation, using a wrapping navtag, unordered list and the aria attributes.</li>
<li>Add a copyright in the footer. For the Â© symbol, use an html entity.</li>
</ol>
Make sure to add and commit your changes when you've got the html done!

<h2>Style Your Page</h2>
<ol>
<li>Use a borderonly on the left side of the page's htmlelement. It should have a width of 5pxand a color of lightgray.</li>
<li>Set the bodyelement's min-heightto be at least 100% of the viewport height. Also, use the font-familyproperty to set the entire page to use sans-seriffonts.</li>
<li>Give the bodya max-widthof 1000px and center it on the page with the margin auto technique.</li>
<br />
The border is too close to our text and we've got an issue with margin-collapse at the top of the page! <br />
<li>Add padding to the header, main and footer elements of 1rem </li>
<li>On the top and bottom and 2rem on the left and right to fix these issues.</li>
<li>For the h1 on the page we want the color to be tomato.</li>
<li>Set all of the images to have a widthof 100%.</li>
<h3>For your site navigation</h3> 
<li>You'll need to remove all of the padding on the ul elements and then set it's list-style-type to none. It would be a good idea to use a class to style the navigation so that you can still make a bulleted list on your page.</li>
<li>Use Flexbox to style the ul for the navigation elements. On the top navigation use the space-between rule to have the menu items spread across their container evenly.</li>
<li>Set the color for the anchors inside the main navigation to be lightgray and the footer navigation to be tomato. </li>
<li>Style the title of each of your blog posts so that they are larger.</li>
<li>Style the 'continues...' anchor tags so that they are aligned to the right and are bold and tomato colored.</li>
<li>Set the margin on the bottom the articletags to be 4rem. Also, add a 1pxsolid border in lightgrayto the bottom of each one and give each padding on the bottom of 2rem.</li>
<li>For the p tag inside your article, use the pseudo-element ::first-letter to style the drop cap and set it's color to lightgray.</li>
<li>Style the copyright so it is lightgray.</li>
</ol>
